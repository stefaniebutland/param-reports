<!--- rendering via Render button, or by quarto::quarto_render() did not add param values into report; it added the literal text below like r params$name. It worked fine in source tutorial and video but not for me. Now worked when I added the r setup bit below --->


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

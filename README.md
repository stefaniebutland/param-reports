# param-reports
Learning paramaterized reports from the bottom up

Thanks John Paul Helveston for 2023 post "Render parameterized reports with Quarto" (no longer [live](https://www.jhelvy.com/posts/2023-02-28-parameterized-pdfs-with-quarto/)?), recording, and [code on GitHub](https://github.com/jhelvy/quarto-pdf-demo) which I copied and ran to understand and get started.

Spending time on this at biweekly Kamloops Data Sci meetups aka Steph @stephwitham and Stef coworking. My original [notes](https://github.com/KamloopsR/Meetup/issues/14).

# Learning how to create parameterized reports using Quarto from the bottom up

I'm using these for my work with Openscapes. This is my lab space (for experiments).
My original [notes](https://github.com/KamloopsR/Meetup/issues/14).
 
### Thank you's always most important

- Nick Tierney @njtierney for showing/ helping me create a parameterized report to make certificates for Openscapes Champions Cohorts. I'm finally getting around to understanding.
- John Paul Helveston @jhelvy for 2023 post "Render parameterized reports with Quarto" (no longer [live](https://www.jhelvy.com/posts/2023-02-28-parameterized-pdfs-with-quarto/)?), recording, and [code on GitHub](https://github.com/jhelvy/quarto-pdf-demo) which I copied and ran to understand and get started.
- Steph Witham @stephwitham for biweekly Kamloops Data Sci meetups aka Stephfs coworking. Thanks to Standard Office Space for the space.
